      <h1>About our project</h1>
      <p class="lead">Visualize NYC schools is a tool for people interested in seeing the environment surrounding the most successful NYC public schools and those that are lagging behind. We think of a school's enviroment as consisting of the actions and demographics of people within its geographic school district. For example, the map shows the number of students enrolled in the district, the percentage of people receiving public assistance, and graffiti reports. Visualize NYC Schools is designed largely with use by policymakers and parents in mind. Parents can see in which districts schools are suceeding when planning in which neighborhood to raise their children. Policymakers can see which environmental factors are related to school success and which are not-- the answers may be suprising. </p>
      <p>To learn about the environment of NYC public schools yourself, why don't you <a href = "index.html">play with it yourself</a> or <a href = findings.html>read our analysis</a></p>?
